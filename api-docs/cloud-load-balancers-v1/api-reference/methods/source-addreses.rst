Source Addresses are public and private IP addresses that provide details for
programatically determining the IP addresses of requests coming from the
load balancers service.

Source Addresses can be obtained directly from the loadbalancer details
resource, see: <example>. These source addresses pertain specifically to the
host the load balancer resides on.

For further automation capabilities cluster and regional source addresses
are provided.
